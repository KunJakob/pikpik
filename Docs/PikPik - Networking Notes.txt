- Send each move unreliably with a "MoveID" (sequenced).
  - Do this several times per move.
  - If the last move we received != movieid, add it to the sequence.

  - Send out the strip we just walked reliably (not ordered).
  - Remove the strip completely on all other machines.
- Even with a failure
