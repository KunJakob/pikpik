Matchmaking
--------------------------------------------------
When matchmaking is implemented, need to add in a "Join Random Server" button to change the server. Each server should
have a unique ID and a generated password that only the host knows about. If the host migrates, he/she passes the
password to the new host. The password is needed to make any changes to the session. To maintain the session, it needs
to have a "ping" sent every 30 seconds with the password. If no ping is sent, the session closes down.
